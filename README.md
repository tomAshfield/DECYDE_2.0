# DECYDE_2.0
Welcome to Decyde 2.0!

Creators: Tommy Ashfield and Gia Scozzarro

Project Description: A tool created for the purpose of helping others who suffer from indecision on a daily basis. The idea origionally stemmed from Tommy Ashfields real life solution to the issue which was to ask the person for their top two activites/ideas, then lock each idea to a number in his head, after that he'd present the user with numbers 1 and 2 to decide what activity will be chosen for the time being. While the website has driven a little away from Tommys origional solution, we've put it a lot of time and effort to make it function properly and user friendly for everyone to enjoy.

Why 2.0?: 

After creating the project first time through there were a few issues with items overlapping, screen size issues, and a few bugs that needed to be fixed in the long run. Now that we have a better understanding of responsive design we're taking it upon ourselves to "restart" and make sure everything is perfect this time around.

Final Message: We the creators hope you find our project useful enough to help midagate this issue and wish you to have fun in any activity we help decyde with you!
